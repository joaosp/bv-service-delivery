00:08 - Joshua Kirby: If you can hear me, we can't hear you.
00:13 - Joshua Kirby: Looks like you're muted.
00:29 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, it looks like you unmuted, but I still don't hear you.
01:12 - Joshua Kirby: I think we heard your mic maybe just a little bit there.
01:17 - Penny Farrell: Can you hear us now?
01:19 - Joshua Kirby: Yes, we can hear.
01:25 - Penny Farrell: Okay, Joshua.
01:27 - Joshua Kirby: Yes.
01:27 - Penny Farrell: Hi, it's Penny. I apologize. I got, I got tied up with a client. Yeah, no way over.
01:38 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: But I'm not sure what is it that we want to do today?
01:42 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so today's call is to essentially gather as much information. So or as much information as possible, so we can start building the services. Okay.
01:51 - Joshua Kirby: So like in regards to the quote, it was listed for 10 standard users, you know, a fact service or physical facts with a, you know, little box that we ship out 10 desk phones and importing six telephone numbers.
02:06 - Joshua Kirby: So for those 10 standard users are these like people with first and last names where they have their own individual. phones.
02:14 - Penny Farrell: Well, sure, but I don't need people's first and last names because, I mean, this, this job is seasonal. So I don't have the same people every year.
02:23 - Joshua Kirby: Gotcha.
02:24 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: So do you want to just give them some sort of like generic name, like Berlin phone one through 10?
02:32 - Penny Farrell: Well, we certainly could do that. I'll tell you what, what I'm most concerned with Joshua is the, the, the, the phones that I have over in the waterbury office from
02:43 - Joshua Kirby: You guys.
02:45 - Penny Farrell - [Longest Customer Story]: There's still such a lack of knowledge in how to use these phones. Like we're not even sure how to transfer calls. We can't get calls. We can't get our messages from another location from that office.
03:02 - Penny Farrell - [Longest Customer Story]: Types of all types of things that we need to get on top of this so we know how to run the phones better. And so this is the reason I never started with Berlin during the tax season.
03:13 - Penny Farrell - [Longest Customer Story]: It's because there's such a cluster going on a bet in, um, in water berry, trying to use these phones because I, I thought that someone might, might actually do some training with us.
03:25 - Penny Farrell: Longest Customer StoryQuestion Is that, is that going to happen?
03:27 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, I can send you guys a email that allow you to schedule some training.
03:32 - Penny Farrell: Yeah. I think that's the most, that's the biggest concern we have.
03:36 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: Um, now, am I supposed to have a beehive account?
03:40 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, that's what you have.
03:42 - Penny Farrell: Don't know anything about it, Joshua.
03:45 - Joshua Kirby: Well, what do you mean?
03:45 - Joshua Kirby: So technically, the service that you're using is called be high. Now, we have ability to give you access to an admin account on there.
03:55 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Is that what you're referring to?
03:58 - Penny Farrell: Right, right. So that I could call, like, I could call my other office from this office and get my messages and all that type of stuff.
04:07 - Joshua Kirby: You know, that's slightly different. So having an admin user is just so you could go in and if you wanted to add services, remove services, make any adjustments to your service. And just being able to call between.
04:20 - Joshua Kirby: Let me see here. Let's take a look.
04:22 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: What, Berlin?
04:23 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, to get my messages
04:24 - Penny Farrell: From anywhere I am, I can get my messages. Like I can now in the Berlin office.
04:29 - Penny Farrell: So you're talking more like the Beehive account would help me say like right now, I think we've got it set up so that the front desk, the phone rings to the front desk four times before it goes to the offices to be answered.
04:42 - Penny Farrell: I would go in there and change now that on the off season, it rings once and then goes to the offices.
04:47 - Joshua Kirby: Exactly.
04:49 - Penny Farrell: Okay. So that's the type of stuff we want some help with and that's why we want the Beehive account. Okay.
04:53 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so what I'll do is I will send you an email once we wrap up and it'll allow you to schedule training. Okay, that'll be great.
05:05 - Joshua Kirby: And then the cool thing is it can be recorded and all of that stuff.
05:07 - Joshua Kirby: So they can send your recording of it and you know, that way you can share it with anyone that, you know, isn't able to make it to that call or anything like that.
05:15 - Joshua Kirby: So and they'll train you on how to do both sides. I'll set you up for the one that gives training for admin. So like stuff like going into the account and I can get you access.
05:23 - Joshua Kirby: To all of that stuff as well. I'll send you another like auto email that I'll just say, you know, hello, thank you for signing up for Bravo is click here to create your password.
05:33 - Joshua Kirby: And you will create a password. Your username will just be your email that we have here on file. And let's see here.
05:45 - Penny Farrell: Yeah, so we'll
05:47 - Joshua Kirby: Make sure to get you that access.
06:04 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, and then just so yeah, so we can get you all that access and you know get you set up as a as an admin and get you access into that and then get you set up for training.
06:14 - Joshua Kirby: In regards to the names for the phones for Berlin. Do you just kind of want to go with a generic naming convention I mean it can always be updated down the road as well.
06:24 - Penny Farrell: Well, and I don't think I want six phone lines because right now we have three phone lines that are coming in and out.
06:31 - Penny Farrell: I got, I don't use one of those phone lines that I had for my fax machine.
06:36 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: Not my fax machine, my credit card machine, right?
06:40 - Joshua Kirby: Right. Yeah. So we don't support because we're going through the internet now. Yes. Exactly. So you're probably doing it through the internet. I was going to say that. Exactly. OK.
06:46 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: So why do I have six phone lines then?
06:50 - Penny Farrell: I think I got to take a look at my Comcast bill.
06:52 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Yeah, I mean, if there is something that you don't need, you would just essentially let us know, right?
06:57 - Joshua Kirby: Because we just go based off of whatever is on the quote. And then when we get, you know, whatever information from you guys, we then just input that based on what you guys provide to us.
07:09 - Penny Farrell: Right, sure. And I think what I provided, because I thought you guys could process my credit cards on the phone line, but you can't. So we've got that with Wi-Fi now.
07:18 - Joshua Kirby: And then, yeah, so the six lines I'm seeing here at Waterbury are is yourself Robin, uh, ... front desk and Dustin.
07:29 - Penny Farrell: Right. Like ... isn't even here anymore. So I really didn't need it to be .... It could just be extra desk now.
07:35 - Penny Farrell: And then, um, as far as is here, I think that we would just have like, um, three and three waterbury, three lines, Berlin, three lines.
07:45 - Steven Hatch: So when you're talking about lines are a very different thing than phones and users. And I think that's a very important thing that you need to understand.
07:54 - Steven Hatch - [Question]: So in Waterbury, how many physical phones do you need?
07:58 - Steven Hatch - [Question]: And in Berlin, how many physical phones do you need?
08:01 - Penny Farrell: So in Waterbury, we have four phones and in Berlin, we're going to need 10. OK, so
08:09 - Steven Hatch: Yeah, there's five. So there's currently five phones in Waterbury. That's right.
08:15 - Penny Farrell: You're right. There's five.
08:16 - Steven Hatch: Okay. So that's not that's not five lines. That's five users. That's right. Yeah. And five phones. So so you don't have six lines.
08:25 - Speaker: You have lines don't really exist, so to speak, in this system.
08:30 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: How many lines do I have in Watebary?
08:33 - Joshua Kirby: You have two telephone numbers at Waterbury, but what he's trying to explain is that it no longer works in the same way where you have like lines.
08:40 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: It's like you have telephone numbers and then you can have users with their own unique phones, whether it be digital or physical, right?
08:47 - Joshua Kirby: And then we can plug in that information in various ways, but it's not really directly tied to lines specifically anymore. So you have two telephone numbers, a main line and a fax line.
08:59 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then we essentially from that main line, there is a way through calling and reach the front desk person, if they don't answer, then it goes to the ring all group, right?
09:09 - Joshua Kirby: You know, it has various ways to then reach how whatever type of call flow you guys, you know, want us to build for you guys.
09:18 - Penny Farrell: Okay.
09:20 - Joshua Kirby: Right?
09:20 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: So like let's say for instance for Berlin, right?
09:22 - Joshua Kirby: If it's 10 phones, we just need to put a naming convention for those 10 phones, depending on the business. Sometimes, you know, hey, it's, you know, this phone is for John and only John will be using this phone.
09:32 - Joshua Kirby: But sometimes like you said, it's like, hey, you know, it's just 10 phones that sit around. Anyone can pick them up. People come people, you know, hop on, people leave off.
09:40 - Joshua Kirby: You know, it could be something where it's just Berlin phone one, Berlin phone two, you know, something, but we do have to put some sort of name on it, but it doesn't have to be first name last name.
09:50 - Joshua Kirby: But that's... not can. Once she gets the beehive
09:53 - Penny Farrell: Account, the admin privileges, would she be able to change these lines or these. phone line, the user names or so.
10:02 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, exactly. That's what I was referring to earlier, exactly. So that's just changing.
10:06 - Joshua Kirby: Essentially, that's just updating the name once you have the know-how, and then just rebooting the phone, which is just turning it off for 10 seconds, plugging it back in, and then it should reboot.
10:17 - Joshua Kirby: Or it happens automatically at midnight every night. Any changes yourself on the admin side or someone from Broad Voice makes, it'll automatically just update at midnight if you didn't want it. have to reboot the phone.
10:29 - Penny Farrell: Okay, and then so in Waterbury, we've had an issue with the fax line not working. When we first got the phones, it, you know, it worked for a little bit and now it's just not been working.
10:44 - Penny Farrell: Is that something that we could possibly see if there's a setting wrong in the beehive admin account to.
10:53 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, we can take a look at that. I'll look into that.
10:57 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: What could be causing?
10:59 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: So you guys are expecting all these problems, huh?
11:01 - Penny Farrell: You were expecting just to set up new service. But I'm sorry, we've been having a lot of issues in Wadi-Bering.
11:08 - Penny Farrell: We're just kind of dealing with it right now, but it'd be great if we could, you know, transferring calls and things like that, putting calls into voicemail.
11:16 - Penny Farrell: Yeah, because when I looked at the training for the beehive account, that gives a lot more stuff that we can do once we have that account.
11:25 - Penny Farrell: But by us not having it, we're kind of restricted in a lot of things.
11:30 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: But I think what you're saying is we've had it all along, right?
11:34 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so, so yeah, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you access to the admin portal, Penny. So you should get that in your email in a couple of minutes.
11:42 - Joshua Kirby: And then so I can also, we can also send you guys some stuff to help with some of the stuff that you guys are referring to, like transferring.
11:52 - Joshua Kirby: In regards to transferring for you guys, you guys didn't initially give oh, well, no, never mind you guys do that extension so With transferring is on your phone.
12:04 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Do you see a button that?
12:07 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Let me see what is the button Steven?
12:08 - Joshua Kirby: Well, you know what the button looks like for the transfer button on the poly edge phones
12:13 - Penny Farrell: Yeah, we know how to transfer. The big problem is figuring out how we can make it ring a certain way or getting the voicemails not being in the office.
12:24 - Joshua Kirby: Gotcha. So getting voicemails not being in the office is pretty simple as well. We can do a voicemail to email transcription.
12:33 - Joshua Kirby: We just need well, we have pennies email and I'm not sure if we have we may or may not have other people. Let me see here.
12:39 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Yeah, I think we only have pennies for now, but we just need email addresses, right?
12:45 - Joshua Kirby: And then we can plug them in and turn on the voicemail to email transcription. And then.
12:51 - Penny Farrell: Well, so there's not a way that you could we could just call into call a number and get into the voicemail.
12:58 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: From out from an outside phone from like your cell phone, right?
13:02 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah. Um, let me think
13:06 - Penny Farrell: Or even having multiple beehive accounts. Cause.
13:12 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: In the beehive account, I believe you can see the voicemails, right?
13:17 - Penny Farrell: Yeah.
13:17 - Steven Hatch: So each user, if they log in to the communicator, which is either on the phone or on a computer, you'd be able to see your own voicemails.
13:26 - Steven Hatch: And if there's a general voicemail, they can be assigned to that as well and see it there.
13:30 - Steven Hatch: The only way to do it by calling in is we would have to, basically, since you don't have an auto attendant or anything, we would have to set up like a separate number for you to call in.
13:38 - Steven Hatch: And you can set it to go to... like a voicemail login.
13:43 - Joshua Kirby: Right. Yeah. That's all. Yeah, exactly. I was going to refer to that too. So we can give you like a free number. And we would essentially just put it to voicemail login.
13:54 - Joshua Kirby: And then you would follow, we would create like a pin and a code for a specific voicemail box.
13:59 - Joshua Kirby: Or for each of you guys would have your own voicemail box to have your own pin and code that then whenever you dial that new number, it would actually, hey, log in with your box number and then type in your pin.
14:11 - Joshua Kirby: And then you would get access to your voicemail, your individual, if you wanted to call directly to check that.
14:19 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: But again, how do we set up the multiple beehive accounts?
14:23 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: Could we do that through her admin account once we get that?
14:27 - Joshua Kirby - [Next Steps]: Yeah, you can do it through the admin account or if you guys just want to make it do it easier I mean you could just get send me an email after this with everyone's email or you know Hey, here's email for Dustin.
14:36 - Joshua Kirby: Here's for the front desk.
14:37 - Joshua Kirby: Here's for you know Whoever we're gonna put for ... hour if that's just left-blank then we leave that one blank and then just robin right And then we would input those and I would do the same thing I just did for penny where I send an auto email out because otherwise, you know You would have to I would have to send you guys instructions But I would have to stay in you instructions on where to go to that because it's not, you know, obviously like one of the first things you'll see when you log in.
15:02 - Joshua Kirby: But yeah, we can get it done for you guys in one of the various ways that we can do it. Whichever, whichever you guys prefer, really, it's up to you guys, whichever most comfortable for you all.
15:13 - Penny Farrell: Okay, so for right now, you know that we need phones in the Berlin office. Right.
15:20 - Joshua Kirby: And I just need to know what you want to name them.
15:21 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Do you want to name anything for right now?
15:24 - Penny Farrell: We can always go in and change them. Just name them, you know, whatever. That's one, that's two, whatever you want to do.
15:30 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect.
15:32 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then do you in regards to how they ring when someone dows in or we just kind of copying the same thing that waterberry has?
15:40 - Penny Farrell: That's okay. Yep.
15:44 - Joshua Kirby: Okay.
15:44 - Joshua Kirby: So I'll just have it ring, you know, what will let's test phone one or because right now that's what it's doing is going to the front desk or do you want it to just ring all the phones simultaneously.
15:55 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: Do I want to what?
15:56 - Joshua Kirby: So for water berry, right now, it's ringing to the front desk person. And then if they don't answer, it goes to a ring.
16:03 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Everyone do you want to do something like that where we have a ring, just one of the phones and then if they don't answer, it rings all of the phones?
16:10 - Penny Farrell: Yep, that'd be great. OK.
16:45 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, perfect.
17:02 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then do you guys are you guys wanting the same?
17:07 - Joshua Kirby: Car parking set up for your buttons for the Berlin phones where you have like three car parks and two presents.
17:18 - Penny Farrell: Yep.
17:29 - Joshua Kirby: Okay.
17:37 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then wherever these are going to be connected, you guys have internet and stuff already set up there, right?
17:45 - Penny Farrell: Yeah.
17:46 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect.
17:48 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And are you sure you have enough internet drop for all of the phones?
17:55 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah. Okay.
17:56 - Penny Farrell: Yeah, because we have phones there now, we're just replacing what we have.
18:02 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect. Okay. Even better. Okay. Perfect.
18:07 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then you also want to fax for this one, a physical fax, right?
18:11 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah.
18:12 - Joshua Kirby: Now for a water berry, as we're on the fax, for a water berry, if it's not working physically, we can put an email on there so you guys can at least receive the faxes in the time being while we work on figuring out whatever the issue is with that one.
18:29 - Penny Farrell: Yeah, definitely. Put your email on it. Okay.
18:33 - Joshua Kirby: Use yours, Penny. Sure. Okay. And we can add as many as you guys want as well. And then let me see here.
18:44 - Steven Hatch: Yeah. And random question, when you say that the fax isn't working, what's actually not happening.
18:50 - Penny Farrell: It just keeps going, saying busy, no response.
18:54 - Steven Hatch: When you're faxing out or faxing in.
18:58 - Penny Farrell: We haven't received the fax in either.
19:06 - Steven Hatch: Okay, I just want to test facts to there. I just, I'm kind of curious as to what'll happen with it.
19:14 - Penny Farrell: We're up there tomorrow. So I know that.
19:17 - Steven Hatch: Well, yeah, I know I kind of figured you were an on site, but yeah. So, but we can kind of see stuff from our side as well a little bit. So yeah, and
19:24 - Joshua Kirby: I want to detect who. So yeah, the number is ported. So it is definitely something with either the machine or. On something on the build side, hopefully. is the number is at least showing as ported.
19:35 - Joshua Kirby: So that's at least good, at least the number is showing as good. And it's not like a number issue.
19:41 - Penny Farrell: There's a, so the little box you had for the plug into the facts, there's a line one in a line two.
19:49 - Penny Farrell: And when it was working, when we first put it in, talking to the phone with someone, line one didn't work. So then we put it in line two when it started working.
20:02 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: So what did matter between if it's in line one or two of that box?
20:06 - Steven Hatch: It should always be in line one.
20:08 - Penny Farrell: Okay.
20:11 - Penny Farrell: So yeah, I don't know what's wrong with it. I went from the brother support for the facts all the way to you guys and yeah, now it's not working.
20:27 - Joshua Kirby: You know what I just noticed, Steven as I went and looked at the device for whatever reason line two. I just went. Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't going crazy.
20:41 - Steven Hatch: No, I just did that because that's a. That that's just something. Yeah. That could cause the issue.
20:48 - Joshua Kirby: Yep. Okay. Makes sense. Okay.
20:51 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then, um, Penny, did you get access?
20:55 - Joshua Kirby: Did you check your email?
20:56 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Or are you going to just plan on doing that later?
20:59 - Penny Farrell: Check my email for what?
21:01 - Joshua Kirby: To get access into the portal.
21:04 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: We're going to set it up later, right?
21:06 - Penny Farrell: Yes. Yeah, we'll set it up.
21:08 - Joshua Kirby: QuestionLongest Monologue Ok, so what I'll do is I'm going to send you guys a bunch of stuff, right?
21:11 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: I'm going to send you guys some walkthroughs that you can look through.
21:15 - Joshua Kirby: Longest MonologueQuestion I'll send one specifically for the admin stuff for the portal side, right?
21:19 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: And then I'm going to send you guys some codes for your phones as well, some dial codes. They're like feature codes that, you know, if you dial different things, they do different things.
21:28 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: And, you know, it'll assist you guys a bit on that end. But then I'm also going to send you guys, that'll be in a direct email from me.
21:34 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: Just after we you know wrapped up this call but then I'm also gonna send you guys an email to schedule training as well and I'm gonna put in the notes that you know you guys want to do training that you guys have two locations You already set up one, but you're setting up a second one now that you guys want training for both locations, just so that way to make it simple for everybody and that way they don't just get any confusion or anything like that.
22:00 - Penny Farrell: Okay. Yeah.
22:02 - Joshua Kirby: Okay.
22:02 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then I think I have, oh, you know, just last thing I think I need from you guys, can we ship the phones to the 1284 US route 302 Berlin, Vermont?
22:09 - Joshua Kirby: Yes. Yeah. 5641.
22:14 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect, okay, so I'll get the I'll start getting the users and the facts and everything at it today. Then I will set for the devices to ship out.
22:26 - Joshua Kirby: We already had the call flow and then just let me see here actually let me take a look at one last thing for your numbers for Berlin. What's the main line is the 9100 correct.
22:38 - Penny Farrell: That's correct. Okay,
22:40 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect. And then what's the facts line. 1734
22:44 - Speaker: Okay. Wait a minute. Is that. Yeah, 1734. Yeah.
22:56 - Joshua Kirby: Perfect, okay.
23:00 - Penny Farrell - [Question]: Because I I've sent you that Comcast bill, so do you do you have that for those numbers?
23:05 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, yeah, I still have all that information.
23:19 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, yeah, so I'll get everything set to ship out.
23:22 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then are the rest of the numbers, or are they direct lines, or are they where they just kind of other numbers you guys had that weren't really being used?
23:30 - Penny Farrell: Well, they're just that we use them all the time. If the calls come in on 9100, if 9100 isn't available, they come in on the next line. Gotcha,
23:40 - Joshua Kirby: Exactly. So that's exactly what we were referring to earlier.
23:42 - Joshua Kirby: That technology is kind of gone away now, right?
23:46 - Joshua Kirby: Where technically the numbers can operate independently from each other and they don't require physical lines to function in the same way.
23:54 - Joshua Kirby: So what we typically do is, you know, let's say for instance, you did want a direct line that, you know, a family or friends can.
24:00 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Reach you on, you know, or even clients, right?
24:02 - Joshua Kirby: You give it out to specific clients, hey, you know, reach me at this line, if you can't reach me at the main number, you know, something along those lines.
24:08 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And if you didn't want that, then we just have it mirror whatever the main line does, right?
24:13 - Joshua Kirby: So it's essentially functioning the same as someone were to somehow know that number. If, you know, they dial it, it'll just ring the same as the 9100.
24:26 - Joshua Kirby: Okay. Okay. And then that was everything I had on my end.
24:31 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Steven, was there anything that you needed on your side?
24:34 - Steven Hatch: Just a few basic pieces of information that I usually gather just to be safe. So like some of the network information just to be safe.
24:42 - Steven Hatch - [Question]: Who's your internet service provider?
24:47 - Penny Farrell: I'm
24:48 - Steven Hatch: Not sure if you have a
25:16 - Steven Hatch: Okay, so just the you just have the Comcast router. Okay. Right. Okay, that's fine.
25:21 - Penny Farrell: No, we don't have an HR block on it. Yeah, we got a. Help this thing go on. We
25:31 - Penny Farrell: Got a cradle point. We got a cradle point router from headquarters. So it's the same setup as what you see in Waterbury. The exact same setup.
25:42 - Steven Hatch: We didn't gather some of that information because it was expedited and it kind of got pushed out really fast. So it should work fine.
25:49 - Steven Hatch - [Next Steps]: But the other thing too, also, it just kind of brings me to this point too, is in this follow up email, we'll make sure Josh gets it out to you, the whitelisting information.
26:03 - Steven Hatch: So like as an example, I sent the test facts on our side. It's shown completely cleared. So if it's having an issue reaching the ATA, it could even be something that's not whitelisted properly on that firewall.
26:15 - Steven Hatch: You know, I'm not saying that is that. I'm just saying that is always a possibility. So I would maybe reach out to whoever does that controls that firewall and give them that information just to be safe.
26:30 - Joshua Kirby: Okay.
26:32 - Steven Hatch: Okay.
26:33 - Penny Farrell: Okay, sounds good.
26:35 - Steven Hatch: Yeah, and Josh, I'll make sure you have that if you don't have it already.
26:39 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, perfect, thank you so much.
26:42 - Steven Hatch: Okay.
26:44 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And Stephen, was that it on your end?
26:47 - Steven Hatch - [Question]: By any chance do you need international calling enabled or does that need to stay off?
26:54 - Penny Farrell: No, I don't think we do.
26:55 - Steven Hatch: Now, and again, just like anything else, nothing is set in stone. So if you need it down the road, you can always call somebody here and get it enabled. Okay. Okay.
27:06 - Joshua Kirby: And you know, it's even real quick.
27:07 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: What, what, what's the code for if they need to reach support for any reason on their phones?
27:12 - Joshua Kirby: Is it star six
27:14 - Steven Hatch - [Question]: One one?
27:15 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah. So if you guys are, yeah, six one one, if you guys do need any assistance directly from your Broadway phones, you can always just dial six one and that gets you direct to support.
27:26 - Penny Farrell: Okay, didn't know that either.
27:29 - Joshua Kirby: Exactly. And so that'll be that. The phones were just in South so
27:32 - Penny Farrell: Quickly over in Waterbury and we were going right into tax season.
27:35 - Penny Farrell: So we were just kind of like flying by the seat of our pants to just get through it, you know?
27:39 - Joshua Kirby: Exactly. And you know, hey, it happens.
27:40 - Joshua Kirby: And like I said, we're here for you guys, you know, thankfully we, you know, I think maybe a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago, two years ago, they started doing the training thing, which has helped tremendously.
27:49 - Joshua Kirby: So, you know, once you guys take a look at the schedule for that and, you know, that's completely on you guys.
27:54 - Joshua Kirby: Once you guys get that schedule, it'll be directly with like a Braver's rep and then they'll walk you through everything.
27:59 - Joshua Kirby: And they'll answer any questions you got, any further questions, and obviously anything that you asked us prior to connecting with them will assist you with too. So.
28:11 - Penny Farrell: Okay, sounds good.
28:13 - Joshua Kirby: All right, and if you both don't have any other questions, then we can go ahead and wrap.
28:17 - Joshua Kirby: And then just keep in mind that if you guys do have anything, feel free to reach out to myself or Steven will be more than happy to assist.
28:23 - Joshua Kirby: Even post completion, you'll have me and him for five business days, and then you'll even have like a dedicated rep for about 60 days.
28:29 - Joshua Kirby: So you guys will be completely covered if you do run into anything from now all the way until even a couple of months after completion. So.
28:37 - Penny Farrell: Okay, well, I really appreciate that. And again, I apologize about being so late for this call. I was having an issue with the client and it just went way over the hour that I scheduled for it.
28:46 - Penny Farrell: So anyways, I think we're all set for now and I'll look at, um, get back to those emails when I get them. Okay.
28:53 - Joshua Kirby: Okay. Perfect.
28:55 - Penny Farrell: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
28:57 - Steven Hatch: You're welcome. Have a
28:59 - Joshua Kirby: Good one. Bye bye. Bye bye.
