00:20 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Is that correct?
00:21 - Patricia Rael: Okay, perfect.
00:23 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: The 3-metered users as well as the 3 analog adapters, is that for paging?
00:31 - Speaker 3: Perfect. Yeah, we have an IP SIP device that does paging as well as it's a bell system so like lunch and stuff.
00:44 - Patricia Rael: Okay, if you could perhaps send me like model information or even send pictures of the current setup. I just want to make sure that the adapters were sending out will work.
00:56 - Patricia Rael: If it's already set based it might just be us entering or giving you new CIP information to enter in the hardware or the software that you have.
01:06 - Patricia Rael: But yeah, the more information we have on that the better, but if not, I mean, it'll still be tied to three metered users. It's just a matter of whether we send you analog adapters or not.
01:16 - Patricia Rael: And then the facts. The facts right now, it looks like it's just effects or will you be doing physical faxing as well.
01:25 - Speaker 3: We, that's a good question. We used to have a copy of it. module in it that actually took physical faxes. We no longer have that copy or so.
01:42 - Patricia Rael: Okay.
01:43 - Speaker 3: There'd be deal with faxes but I mean I guess it seems to be. Take a bit.
01:52 - Patricia Rael: Sorry you cut off a little bit
01:53 - Speaker 3: There at the end. Okay it does happen occasionally that like some of our customers have the fax like a drawing or something like that. So I guess the E facts would be fine.
02:06 - Patricia Rael: Okay, perfect.
02:08 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And very quickly, what is your main number?
02:13 - Speaker 3: The main number is 714 Okay,
02:21 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And what is the facts number that you have?
02:26 - Speaker 3: Challenges I'm going to have to double check on that, but I believe it's 0700. There is 700.
02:35 - Patricia Rael: Yep, that looks like it.
02:38 - Speaker 3: Let me confirm with you just in case.
02:42 - Patricia Rael: Okay, I do see that number listed in the LOA. So it is 714-578-0700. So I think we're good there. There's Joshua. Joshua just joined us. Hey, Josh. Hey guys, apologies about that. No worries, I was speaking with Will.
02:57 - Patricia Rael: I did get, you know, confirm the quote. And then I was just going through the numbers very quickly. The three meter users are for paging. They might need the analog adapters.
03:09 - Patricia Rael: I'm going to have them send me some pictures or more information on what they're currently used because it sounds like it might already be sit based and we wouldn't need to send out the analog adapters.
03:20 - Patricia Rael: The facts will be effects. And that's all I got to you so far. So if you want to go ahead and. do the rest of your portion, then I'll go through mine.
03:29 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so the faxes, the three faxes will be effects or it's just one fax and that'll be effects.
03:37 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then what about for with the the three meter users?
03:44 - Patricia Rael: Yeah, the three meter users are paging and that's why I said the three analog adapters might be needed for them. But once I get more information, I'll let you know for sure.
03:53 - Joshua Kirby: Gotcha. OK, perfect. Perfect. OK. All righty, so yeah, so the major thing that I would need from your end is, so for the 53 users, it's more than likely multiple people, first and last name, sort of a setup.
04:14 - Speaker 3: Yeah.
04:15 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so what we would need at that point. So we I'm going to send you an Excel sheet. And on that Excel sheet, we have it'll have like first name, last name.
04:31 - Joshua Kirby: If they have extensions, you can go ahead and list that there. Anyone who would need access to either like a portal or if you wanted to give anyone like administrative access, you would add their email.
04:42 - Joshua Kirby: Those are the most important things we would need on there. So then that way we can import that into the system, get the phones added and set the equipment to get shipped out and everything.
04:54 - Joshua Kirby: So I will send that over to you after our call and then just get that filled out.
04:59 - Joshua Kirby: Now obviously... the faster we receive it, the faster we can get them at it and get the phone set to ship out and everything. And obviously the longer it takes for us to do all of that as well.
05:11 - Speaker 3: Got you. The only hold up I can imagine on my end is that I have a couple of extensions that probably aren't going to work for you. I have 311 and 411.
05:27 - Speaker 3: I just have to figure out what I can move that extension to. But that involved just me asking the user and figuring out business cards and ... like that.
05:37 - Speaker 3: So if you could give me a maybe, you maybe a couple hours on that, that would be helpful.
05:44 - Patricia Rael: Yep, and you can always leave those ones blank for now because we can add an extension number later or adjust an extension number.
05:51 - Patricia Rael: As long as we have the name and email address so that way we can build that user and add the hardware.
05:58 - Speaker 3: Got you. Okay. Okay, if you know. And I'll probably have a bunch that. probably have at least 10 that won't have any name information yet.
06:12 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: Is that going to be a problem?
06:15 - Speaker 3: If you can just be generic. If you have a generic user
06:18 - Patricia Rael: One through 10, and then if you yourself have admin access, you can update that later.
06:24 - Speaker 3: Perfect. Okay.
06:27 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah. And then even for the one, and I'm not my. by my thing was going to be in and out.
06:33 - Joshua Kirby: So you might have already stated this, but for the ones that 311, for the meantime, you can always just add, if you put them on there, just so we can get it set up and get it kind of get the ball rolling.
06:46 - Joshua Kirby: What we can do is you can just add an extra one at the end.
06:51 - Speaker 3: Oh, okay. All right. Yeah.
06:53 - Joshua Kirby: So instead of just doing 4-1-1, you know, you would do 4-1-1-1, you
06:57 - Speaker 3: Know, 3-1-1-1. Okay, cool.
07:02 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, that's what I usually do. And then let's see here.
07:06 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And for the equipment, are we shipping that?
07:11 - Joshua Kirby: Let me see here. To the 3-7-1-8 capital F, city of Industry California, 90601. Yeah.
07:20 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, so yeah, we can definitely do that. Let me see here. I'm just going through making sure I have everything I need.
07:32 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then we're just only porting the two numbers, correct, the main line and the facts line, correct?
07:38 - Speaker 3: I will double check on that when I'm virtually certain. Those are the only two numbers that have been ever associated with Maverick Aerospace, but I will double check.
07:46 - Joshua Kirby: Gotcha, no worries. Okay, so here's what we can do.
07:48 - Joshua Kirby: So, well, here's how it'll go from, you know, the, you know, Patricia might have some things that she wants to go over a bit more on her in, possibly, but just from my end, what'll happen essentially from here is, you know, we'll go ahead, you know, get the user information from you, get it at it, get the phones at it, you know, set to have that shipped out.
08:10 - Joshua Kirby: And then from there, you know, we already have the two numbers, we know which one is the main and which one of the facts. It's pretty simple.
08:15 - Joshua Kirby: And from there, it's just, the coplo setup, which I believe on here, it says an attendant. like a written or recorded script that
08:30 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, we would need like a written or a verbal script that, you know, has whatever messaging you want to put on there. Hello, thank you for calling Mavic Arrow, you know, for one press this.
08:40 - Joshua Kirby: Now what we would need alongside that unless it's extremely obvious, you know, hey option one goes to John, option two goes to Sally.
08:47 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: We need just a simple breakdown of, you know, hey, if option one goes to sales, you know, is that a person?
08:52 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Is that a group of people?
08:53 - Joshua Kirby: We just need a simple breakdown explaining, you know, what each option is doing on the attendant.
09:00 - Speaker 3: Okay, that's not a problem.
09:02 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: Do you want me to add that on the extension sheet?
09:05 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: Can I add a column for like groups?
09:07 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, if you what you can do is you can like tours at the bottom of the sheet, you know, just go a couple of spaces down and then if you want, you can, you know, if it's just going to be a written script, you can put all the information there.
09:17 - Joshua Kirby: But if it's just the breakdown for the attendant and, you know, like, and like just for the options, then, yeah, you can either one, you can do it there, but just do it at the bottom.
09:35 - Joshua Kirby: Either one of them you can. So if you want to just provide the whole script there or you know, if you send over recording with the breakdown there, then yeah, that's fine. And they will have that there.
09:46 - Joshua Kirby: And then do you have it will like after hours quote unquote, you know, does it do anything different or is this recording or the message going to just play 24 seven.
09:58 - Speaker 3: Probably. Yeah, probably after hours, we would have a little bit different. Probably other go to. straight to voicemail or
10:08 - Speaker 3: I got to see like what we have right now. I think that's what it does. Basically it's a message saying like you know we're closed offices closed.
10:16 - Speaker 3: You can leave a message or call back you know within business hours in the next day.
10:21 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, Jen, do you know what the business hours
10:26 - Speaker 3: Are?
10:27 - Speaker 3: To 5.
10:30 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And what time zone?
10:33 - Joshua Kirby: Pacific.
10:33 - Speaker 3: 7.
10:35 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Who cares?
10:37 - Joshua Kirby: Ok, yeah. And then we so yeah, so just put both. Put the during business hours and then after hours, whatever the message is for that.
10:44 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And you can even just put like goals to voicemail, after hours, and says this, right?
10:50 - Joshua Kirby: Or something along those lines.
10:55 - Joshua Kirby: Okay, and so that is virtually all the information I need on my end. So yeah, so essentially, you know, I'll just kind of be on hold for the user detail sheet. And then once we get the attendant information.
11:12 - Joshua Kirby: So what we do is we typically do wait for the to get the attendant information back. Just because, you know, once submitting the port, we want to make sure that there's no life errors and a hiccup.
11:22 - Joshua Kirby: Just because, you know, that can, that is the one space where issues could potentially arrive because technically and legally, when the losing carrier provides us with a date,
11:37 - Joshua Kirby: Of the time they honor it. But for whatever reason, we need to change the date for any unforeseen circumstances or anything, or we just need to push the order back.
11:46 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: They're not obligated to You know, adjust for us once they've already said, hey, yeah, we'll release the number, right?
11:54 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: So we don't ever really run into that issue, but it is an issue that could happen, right?
11:59 - Joshua Kirby - [Next Steps]: So what we like to do is make sure we just have the attendant information first. And then once we get that, what's you're going to send it over with the user detail sheet, then I'll submit the port.
12:07 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: Is there any day that you need to go like live on or by or?
12:11 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: I mean, what typically what?
12:19 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: Typically what is like how long does it take in order to I mean like if you submitted it today, how long does it typically take?
12:26 - Joshua Kirby: Um, I mean, it can take anywhere. I mean, let's say, Prince, we submitted today. I could probably get it anywhere between the 27th to 28th.
12:38 - Joshua Kirby: So anywhere between like three two five business days from the day we submit it, we can usually get a date or anywhere like three, four, five days.
12:47 - Joshua Kirby: It just very, it kind of depends on what time of year, have a holiday is around, you know, that sort of stuff.
12:52 - Speaker 3: I got you. I mean, like, I think that.
12:56 - Speaker 3 - [Question]: Trying to work it around the labor day, it's coming up right?
13:01 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, the laborly. Yeah.
13:04 - Speaker 3: I think that's what we would try to kind of center it around. I mean, it would be great to do it over that weekend because that would be at all possible. But
13:15 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so we wouldn't be able to do it necessarily over the weekend.
13:18 - Joshua Kirby: We could like set up like give you a temporary number and then you set it up like the Friday, get it connected the Friday before and do like a call forwarding and then the like get all the phones connected, you know, and stuff like that, get everything kind of preset up with the temporary number and then do like a call forwarding on Friday or you know, on that Saturday or whatever with the losing carrier, you know, say, hey, we want to do a call forwarding to this temporary number and then on the following Monday or so we could port.
13:49 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: But I think Labor Day is on the first, right?
13:53 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, I think it's the first this year.
13:59 - Speaker: It's on the first. Just so you
14:00 - Patricia Rael: Know, Josh, I'm not available all of next week. And then the following week, I'm not a free the second, the third I am for a little bit, the fourth is out completely and the Friday the fifth.
14:13 - Patricia Rael: So that would be a squeeze.
14:17 - Speaker 3: Got to. Okay. Plus the hardware. Okay.
14:20 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: How long does the hardware take to get there?
14:21 - Patricia Rael: Yeah, roughly five two seven days.
14:23 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, yeah, well, usually it can depend anywhere between three two seven, you know, it can kind of greatly vary just depending on how you PS how busy UPS is. That's true. Yeah.
14:35 - Speaker 3: Okay. Yeah, so yeah, so as far as things that won't work, I mean, I don't really think there are any. As long as we can get the full setup, I think we're good.
14:49 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, exactly.
14:50 - Joshua Kirby: So yeah, so what we'll do is we can retouch that via email when we get a little like once we get the user detail sheet back once we get everything added and shipped out, we can kind of go based on that right and say, okay, you know, let's look at our schedules, let's see what's open and then we can go from there and get everything scheduled and stuff.
15:09 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, so I'll go ahead and pass it over to Tricia. Did you have anything else that you needed to go
15:14 - Speaker: Over?
15:17 - Speaker 3: Not that I can really think of right now. I think we touched on pretty much everything.
15:22 - Joshua Kirby - [Question]: And then Patricia, did you have anything that she needed to?
15:25 - Patricia Rael: Yeah, just a little bit.
15:27 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: So network wise, who's your internet service provider?
15:32 - Speaker 3: Frontier.
15:33 - Patricia Rael: Frontier?
15:34 - Patricia Rael: Okay.
15:35 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: What kind of connection is that?
15:37 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Is that a DSL cable fiber with them?
15:41 - Speaker 3: It's, um, it's fiber. It's a fiber line. Okay. Yeah.
15:49 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And then behind that, do you have a third party firewall in use?
15:54 - Speaker 3: We do. Yes.
15:56 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Do you know what type of firewall it is?
15:58 - Patricia Rael: It's a sonic. Okay. Perfect. Awesome.
16:02 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And do you manage that?
16:06 - Patricia Rael: Okay perfect.
16:09 - Speaker 3: Yeah, three buildings. Each one, well no, they're actually one and two are connected by the fiber so there's actually two locations really, three buildings and yeah they're both on sonic walls and yeah that's really it.
16:31 - Joshua Kirby: Okay.
16:33 - Patricia Rael: Got it. And then local network is that static or DHCP because these phones will be plug and play if it's just a DHCP.
16:43 - Speaker 3: It's static.
16:44 - Patricia Rael: Okay. So that's internal network. So we would need to assign the phones a static IP beforehand.
16:54 - Speaker 3: Okay, yeah.
17:02 - Patricia Rael - [Next Steps]: I'll send you via email just like a screenshot of the information that we would need for each phone before. Okay. All right.
17:10 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Are any wall mounts needed for any of the phones?
17:15 - Speaker 3: Yeah. I wonder how many though. So it's six shops, two shops, three shops.
17:27 - Speaker 3: I think probably five.
17:36 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: I'm just you have cost for that or do you need to get pricing on that?
17:41 - Speaker 3: I'm sorry. You broke
17:42 - Patricia Rael: Up. Hey, sorry about that. Sorry about that. I think I was
17:46 - Joshua Kirby: Pricing Meeting up with you said the cost for the wall mounts. Yeah, well, that's there is an extra cost and it's a poly edge. The 350. Let me see here the wall mounts.
18:06 - Joshua Kirby - [Next Steps]: Yeah, you know, I'll have to look. I'll get the price over to you in mind because I was in a wrap up email at the after we're done. I will send it over to you.
18:15 - Speaker 3: Yeah. Thank you. Awesome.
18:18 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Okay, so and then there's a ethernet drops at each location of phones going to be installed right?
18:24 - Speaker 3: Yes.
18:25 - Patricia Rael: Okay, these phones technically are Wi-Fi capable. We just don't want a full Wi-Fi layout with this many phones. So if the majority can be hardwired, that would be great.
18:36 - Speaker 3: Absolutely. Yeah, there's I mean, I maybe a couple I would think about putting on Wi-Fi, but they'll all be hardwired.
18:43 - Patricia Rael: Okay, great.
18:44 - Patricia Rael: And then in the user details, if you could just list since there is three separate paging, just let me know if there's an extension tied to them because we can add those, I don't know if your current phones, if they have them as like a speed dial button or anything like that to page.
18:59 - Speaker 3: There is. So yes, I will add those.
19:03 - Patricia Rael: Perfect.
19:04 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And then we did get that your main number when it's dialed right now, it just goes straight to a menu, correct?
19:10 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Or does it ring into like person first?
19:14 - Speaker 3: Okay. Go straight.
19:16 - Patricia Rael: Okay.
19:17 - Patricia Rael: If you do want to keep that same greeting, what I can do is I can call in and retrieve that, or if you have access to the audio file directly, you can always send that to us, but I usually just call in and I can record it.
19:30 - Speaker 3: Yeah, I mean, that would be that would be perfect because I don't think I can get that from our current provider. Okay.
19:39 - Patricia Rael: Yeah, no problem. I'll call in and get it. If I have any questions on that to you, I know you said you'll send the group information. If you want to add that in the sheet, that's perfectly fine.
19:48 - Patricia Rael - [Next Steps]: Or if I have any other questions on any other menu options, I'll reach out to you via email on that.
19:55 - Patricia Rael: I'll call after hours to just to see what the greeting is there and see if it's just going to a voicemail or just an announcement.
20:03 - Speaker 3: Okay, great.
20:04 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Do you want voicemail to email enabled for all users?
20:08 - Patricia Rael: So if someone gets a message, they'll get an audio copy. OK, perfect.
20:13 - Speaker 3: Yeah, I would say so. That's the kind of the way I set up now. I don't even know if people actually use it, but that's how it's set up now.
20:21 - Patricia Rael: Ok, great.
20:22 - Patricia Rael: Do you need international dialing enabled?
20:27 - Speaker 3: Um, not really. Yeah, okay.
20:31 - Patricia Rael: It's not common anymore, but.
20:34 - Speaker 3: Okay, yeah, okay, okay.
20:37 - Patricia Rael: It's not common. What I can do though. Yeah, I mean, what's happened stuff, make it kind of null now.
20:44 - Patricia Rael: But in case you did need it, what I could do is like if yourself as an admin wants to enable it for a user, you can.
20:50 - Patricia Rael: So I'll enable it on an account level, but technically no one would still be able to dial unless you enabled it for them.
21:00 - Patricia Rael: Okay.
21:02 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: And then do you currently have Loype phones or is that what your current setup is?
21:08 - Speaker 3: Yeah we have Sangoma excuse me we mostly Sangoma 500 series.
21:14 - Patricia Rael: Okay do your phones have any special configurations like call parks so if you place someone on a park everybody can see that call waiting.
21:24 - Speaker: Um
21:26 - Speaker 3: No I will I don't think so.
21:31 - Patricia Rael - [Question]: Okay, is that something you'd like to add to your phones?
21:34 - Patricia Rael: Because it's a feature we can add. It's instead of placing them on hold, because only your phone would see that call waiting if you placed them on hold.
21:41 - Patricia Rael: You placed them on a park and everybody can see that call waiting and can pick it up by pressing the park button.
21:47 - Speaker 3: I wouldn't think that could be useful, yeah.
21:50 - Patricia Rael: Okay, a few call parks. And then you have quite a few users, so we can't really add another feature called a BLF or a presence for everyone.
22:00 - Patricia Rael: But each phone or each user can kind of personalize their phone with certain users that maybe they monitor a lot or that they call a lot.
22:10 - Patricia Rael: So that might be better to just work on afterwards, just because it's probably easier to see and personalize once once the users have the funds in front of them.
22:22 - Speaker 3: Yeah, we have a thing said to be totally agree.
22:24 - Patricia Rael: Ok. And then we'll also just make sure we have the speed dials for paging preset as well. Once I get the user details in the extensions for them, then I'll make sure that's added.
22:37 - Speaker 3: Okay,
22:37 - Patricia Rael: Perfect. Okay, I think I have everything I need.
22:43 - Patricia Rael: Do you have any questions for me?
22:46 - Speaker 3: I don't but at this point, no, I don't. I think everything sounds pretty clear cut.
22:52 - Patricia Rael: Okay, yeah, perfect. If you do have anything come up, you can always reach out to myself or Josh. But I'll get you back to Joshua then to wrap it up. Thank you.
23:02 - Speaker 3: Perfect. Thank you so much.
23:04 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: Okay, yeah. And so like I said earlier, you know, I will go ahead and send kind of a wrap up email and just kind of rehashing everything we discussed.
23:11 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: If you have anything for us, we're free to reach out. We'll be more than happy to hop in and assist.
23:16 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: You know, even post, you know, completion of the order you'll have myself interest for five days, five business days. So if you do need any assistance, it won't be with anyone new. You don't have to re explain anything.
23:28 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: And yeah, from there, we'll just kind of be pending a couple of things from you. And then once we do that, you know, I'll get everything.
23:34 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: We'll start to get the stuff added and built, get the port submitted, ship our phones. And then from there, we'll work out an activation date.
23:44 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest MonologueNext Steps]: Once we get to shipping the phones and submitting the port and stuff, I'll reach out to you on that day. We'll coordinate and figure out a date that's best for us to go live.
23:54 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: And then from there, we'll just be kind of pending the phones getting delivered, waiting for that date. And then once we're there, we'll go ahead and now what we always like to recommend to recommend.
24:04 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: Depending on your setup is if you can have phone phones plugged in, especially because they come pre-provisioned.
24:11 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: If you can get phones plugged in before, if you can have like enough, you know, forced to have like two phones sitting at the desk at the same time, you know, that's great.
24:20 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: Cause then on the day of, you don't have to go around, you know, and actually do a one by one or, you know, pass them around and tell everyone, hey, connect them.
24:27 - Joshua Kirby - [Longest Monologue]: But if that works better for you, then obviously we can do that as well. So.
24:31 - Speaker: Okay.
24:34 - Speaker 3: Yeah, some offices probably won't probably be possible, but some for sure have like an extra ethernet port, so that wouldn't be a problem. Perfect. Perfect.
24:47 - Joshua Kirby: Yeah, and then, you know, like I say, any questions or anything, just reach out to us. And if you don't have any other questions, we can go ahead and let you go.
24:55 - Speaker 3: Sounds good. I don't have any more questions at this time now. We're good.
25:00 - Joshua Kirby: All righty, well, thank you for hopping on with us and hopefully you enjoy the rest of your day.
25:05 - Speaker 3: Thank you, you too. Thank you so much for your help.
25:08 - Joshua Kirby: You're welcome. Take care.
25:09 - Patricia Rael: Bye-bye. You
25:10 - Speaker 3: Guys have a good one. Bye.
25:11 - Patricia Rael: You too.
