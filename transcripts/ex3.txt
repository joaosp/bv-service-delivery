00:02
Now 53 standard users, 3-metered users, 1 shared fax, 1 auto attendant, 3 analog adapters, and then 53 polycom edge E350 phones.
Move the player to 20.01 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
00:20
Question
Is that correct?
Move the player to 21.91 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
00:21
Okay, perfect.
Move the player to 23.81 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
00:23
Question
The 3-metered users as well as the 3 analog adapters, is that for paging?
Move the player to 31.96 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
00:31
Perfect. Yeah, we have an IP SIP device that does paging as well as it's a bell system so like lunch and stuff.
Move the player to 44.62 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
00:44
Okay, if you could perhaps send me like model information or even send pictures of the current setup. I just want to make sure that the adapters were sending out will work.
Move the player to 56.13 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
00:56
If it's already set based it might just be us entering or giving you new CIP information to enter in the hardware or the software that you have.
Move the player to 66.64 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
01:06
But yeah, the more information we have on that the better, but if not, I mean, it'll still be tied to three metered users. It's just a matter of whether we send you analog adapters or not.
Move the player to 76.81 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
01:16
And then the facts. The facts right now, it looks like it's just effects or will you be doing physical faxing as well.
Move the player to 85.93 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
01:25
We, that's a good question. We used to have a copy of it. module in it that actually took physical faxes. We no longer have that copy or so.
Move the player to 102.9 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
01:42
Okay.
Move the player to 103.51 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
01:43
There'd be deal with faxes but I mean I guess it seems to be. Take a bit.
Move the player to 112.12 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
01:52
Sorry you cut off a little bit
Move the player to 113.46 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
01:53
There at the end. Okay it does happen occasionally that like some of our customers have the fax like a drawing or something like that. So I guess the E facts would be fine.
Move the player to 126.74 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:06
Okay, perfect.
Move the player to 128.3 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:08
Question
And very quickly, what is your main number?
Move the player to 133.22 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
02:13
The main number is 714 Okay,
Move the player to 141.82 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:21
Question
And what is the facts number that you have?
Move the player to 146.92 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
02:26
Challenges
I'm going to have to double check on that, but I believe it's 0700. There is 700.
Move the player to 155.85 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:35
Yep, that looks like it.
Move the player to 158.25 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
02:38
Let me confirm with you just in case.
Move the player to 162.08 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:42
Okay, I do see that number listed in the LOA. So it is 714-578-0700. So I think we're good there. There's Joshua. Joshua just joined us. Hey, Josh. Hey guys, apologies about that. No worries, I was speaking with Will.
Move the player to 177.6 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
02:57
I did get, you know, confirm the quote. And then I was just going through the numbers very quickly. The three meter users are for paging. They might need the analog adapters.
Move the player to 189.84 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
03:09
I'm going to have them send me some pictures or more information on what they're currently used because it sounds like it might already be sit based and we wouldn't need to send out the analog adapters.
Move the player to 200.58 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
03:20
The facts will be effects. And that's all I got to you so far. So if you want to go ahead and. do the rest of your portion, then I'll go through mine.
Move the player to 209.71 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
03:29
Yeah, so the faxes, the three faxes will be effects or it's just one fax and that'll be effects.
Move the player to 217.54 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
03:37
Question
And then what about for with the the three meter users?
Move the player to 224.76 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
03:44
Yeah, the three meter users are paging and that's why I said the three analog adapters might be needed for them. But once I get more information, I'll let you know for sure.
Move the player to 233.36 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
03:53
Gotcha. OK, perfect. Perfect. OK. All righty, so yeah, so the major thing that I would need from your end is, so for the 53 users, it's more than likely multiple people, first and last name, sort of a setup.
Move the player to 254.09 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
04:14
Yeah.
Move the player to 255.31 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:15
Yeah, so what we would need at that point. So we I'm going to send you an Excel sheet. And on that Excel sheet, we have it'll have like first name, last name.
Move the player to 271.96 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:31
If they have extensions, you can go ahead and list that there. Anyone who would need access to either like a portal or if you wanted to give anyone like administrative access, you would add their email.
Move the player to 282.93 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:42
Those are the most important things we would need on there. So then that way we can import that into the system, get the phones added and set the equipment to get shipped out and everything.
Move the player to 294.8 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:54
So I will send that over to you after our call and then just get that filled out.
Move the player to 299.82 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:59
Now obviously... the faster we receive it, the faster we can get them at it and get the phone set to ship out and everything. And obviously the longer it takes for us to do all of that as well.
Move the player to 311.49 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
05:11
Got you. The only hold up I can imagine on my end is that I have a couple of extensions that probably aren't going to work for you. I have 311 and 411.
Move the player to 327.84 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
05:27
I just have to figure out what I can move that extension to. But that involved just me asking the user and figuring out business cards and ... like that.
Move the player to 337.56 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
05:37
So if you could give me a maybe, you maybe a couple hours on that, that would be helpful.
Move the player to 344.4 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
05:44
Yep, and you can always leave those ones blank for now because we can add an extension number later or adjust an extension number.
Move the player to 351.53 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
05:51
As long as we have the name and email address so that way we can build that user and add the hardware.
Move the player to 358.77 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
05:58
Got you. Okay. Okay, if you know. And I'll probably have a bunch that. probably have at least 10 that won't have any name information yet.
Move the player to 372.7 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
06:12
Question
Is that going to be a problem?
Move the player to 375.08 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
06:15
If you can just be generic. If you have a generic user
Move the player to 378.28 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
06:18
One through 10, and then if you yourself have admin access, you can update that later.
Move the player to 384.52 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
06:24
Perfect. Okay.
Move the player to 387.41 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:27
Yeah. And then even for the one, and I'm not my. by my thing was going to be in and out.
Move the player to 393.22 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:33
So you might have already stated this, but for the ones that 311, for the meantime, you can always just add, if you put them on there, just so we can get it set up and get it kind of get the ball rolling.
Move the player to 406.51 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:46
What we can do is you can just add an extra one at the end.
Move the player to 411.68 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
06:51
Oh, okay. All right. Yeah.
Move the player to 413.26 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:53
So instead of just doing 4-1-1, you know, you would do 4-1-1-1, you
Move the player to 417.74 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
06:57
Know, 3-1-1-1. Okay, cool.
Move the player to 422.98 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:02
Yeah, that's what I usually do. And then let's see here.
Move the player to 426.44 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:06
Question
And for the equipment, are we shipping that?
Move the player to 431.1 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:11
Let me see here. To the 3-7-1-8 capital F, city of Industry California, 90601. Yeah.
Move the player to 440.01 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:20
Okay, so yeah, we can definitely do that. Let me see here. I'm just going through making sure I have everything I need.
Move the player to 452.78 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:32
Question
And then we're just only porting the two numbers, correct, the main line and the facts line, correct?
Move the player to 458.53 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
07:38
I will double check on that when I'm virtually certain. Those are the only two numbers that have been ever associated with Maverick Aerospace, but I will double check.
Move the player to 466.27 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:46
Gotcha, no worries. Okay, so here's what we can do.
Move the player to 468.97 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:48
So, well, here's how it'll go from, you know, the, you know, Patricia might have some things that she wants to go over a bit more on her in, possibly, but just from my end, what'll happen essentially from here is, you know, we'll go ahead, you know, get the user information from you, get it at it, get the phones at it, you know, set to have that shipped out.
Move the player to 490.35 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:10
And then from there, you know, we already have the two numbers, we know which one is the main and which one of the facts. It's pretty simple.
Move the player to 495.45 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:15
And from there, it's just, the coplo setup, which I believe on here, it says an attendant. like a written or recorded script that
Move the player to 510.78 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:30
Yeah, we would need like a written or a verbal script that, you know, has whatever messaging you want to put on there. Hello, thank you for calling Mavic Arrow, you know, for one press this.
Move the player to 520.77 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:40
Now what we would need alongside that unless it's extremely obvious, you know, hey option one goes to John, option two goes to Sally.
Move the player to 527.09 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:47
Question
We need just a simple breakdown of, you know, hey, if option one goes to sales, you know, is that a person?
Move the player to 532.41 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:52
Question
Is that a group of people?
Move the player to 533.61 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:53
We just need a simple breakdown explaining, you know, what each option is doing on the attendant.
Move the player to 540.29 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
09:00
Okay, that's not a problem.
Move the player to 542.34 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
09:02
Question
Do you want me to add that on the extension sheet?
Move the player to 545.11 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
09:05
Question
Can I add a column for like groups?
Move the player to 547.47 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:07
Yeah, if you what you can do is you can like tours at the bottom of the sheet, you know, just go a couple of spaces down and then if you want, you can, you know, if it's just going to be a written script, you can put all the information there.
Move the player to 557.6 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:17
But if it's just the breakdown for the attendant and, you know, like, and like just for the options, then, yeah, you can either one, you can do it there, but just do it at the bottom.
Move the player to 575.57 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:35
Either one of them you can. So if you want to just provide the whole script there or you know, if you send over recording with the breakdown there, then yeah, that's fine. And they will have that there.
Move the player to 586.01 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:46
And then do you have it will like after hours quote unquote, you know, does it do anything different or is this recording or the message going to just play 24 seven.
Move the player to 598.14 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
09:58
Probably. Yeah, probably after hours, we would have a little bit different. Probably other go to. straight to voicemail or
Move the player to 608.66 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
10:08
I got to see like what we have right now. I think that's what it does. Basically it's a message saying like you know we're closed offices closed.
Move the player to 616.1 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
10:16
You can leave a message or call back you know within business hours in the next day.
Move the player to 621.75 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:21
Yeah, Jen, do you know what the business hours
Move the player to 626.33 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
10:26
Are?
Move the player to 627.07 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
10:27
To 5.
Move the player to 630.47 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:30
Question
And what time zone?
Move the player to 633.11 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:33
Pacific.
Move the player to 633.41 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
10:33
7.
Move the player to 635.23 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:35
Question
Who cares?
Move the player to 637.17 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:37
Ok, yeah. And then we so yeah, so just put both. Put the during business hours and then after hours, whatever the message is for that.
Move the player to 644.1 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:44
Question
And you can even just put like goals to voicemail, after hours, and says this, right?
Move the player to 650.27 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:50
Or something along those lines.
Move the player to 655.5 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:55
Okay, and so that is virtually all the information I need on my end. So yeah, so essentially, you know, I'll just kind of be on hold for the user detail sheet. And then once we get the attendant information.
Move the player to 672.34 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:12
So what we do is we typically do wait for the to get the attendant information back. Just because, you know, once submitting the port, we want to make sure that there's no life errors and a hiccup.
Move the player to 682.63 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:22
Just because, you know, that can, that is the one space where issues could potentially arrive because technically and legally, when the losing carrier provides us with a date,
Move the player to 697.38 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:37
Of the time they honor it. But for whatever reason, we need to change the date for any unforeseen circumstances or anything, or we just need to push the order back.
Move the player to 706.67 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:46
Question
They're not obligated to You know, adjust for us once they've already said, hey, yeah, we'll release the number, right?
Move the player to 714.24 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:54
Question
So we don't ever really run into that issue, but it is an issue that could happen, right?
Move the player to 719.54 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:59
Next Steps
So what we like to do is make sure we just have the attendant information first. And then once we get that, what's you're going to send it over with the user detail sheet, then I'll submit the port.
Move the player to 727.61 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:07
Question
Is there any day that you need to go like live on or by or?
Move the player to 731.99 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
12:11
Question
I mean, what typically what?
Move the player to 739.26 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
12:19
Question
Typically what is like how long does it take in order to I mean like if you submitted it today, how long does it typically take?
Move the player to 746.93 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:26
Um, I mean, it can take anywhere. I mean, let's say, Prince, we submitted today. I could probably get it anywhere between the 27th to 28th.
Move the player to 758.04 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:38
So anywhere between like three two five business days from the day we submit it, we can usually get a date or anywhere like three, four, five days.
Move the player to 767.44 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:47
It just very, it kind of depends on what time of year, have a holiday is around, you know, that sort of stuff.
Move the player to 772.7 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
12:52
I got you. I mean, like, I think that.
Move the player to 776.31 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
12:56
Question
Trying to work it around the labor day, it's coming up right?
Move the player to 781.97 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:01
Yeah, the laborly. Yeah.
Move the player to 784.61 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
13:04
I think that's what we would try to kind of center it around. I mean, it would be great to do it over that weekend because that would be at all possible. But
Move the player to 795.17 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:15
Yeah, so we wouldn't be able to do it necessarily over the weekend.
Move the player to 798.47 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:18
We could like set up like give you a temporary number and then you set it up like the Friday, get it connected the Friday before and do like a call forwarding and then the like get all the phones connected, you know, and stuff like that, get everything kind of preset up with the temporary number and then do like a call forwarding on Friday or you know, on that Saturday or whatever with the losing carrier, you know, say, hey, we want to do a call forwarding to this temporary number and then on the following Monday or so we could port.
Move the player to 829.54 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:49
Question
But I think Labor Day is on the first, right?
Move the player to 833.97 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:53
Yeah, I think it's the first this year.
Move the player to 839.01 seconds in the call
Speaker
13:59
It's on the first. Just so you
Move the player to 840.55 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
14:00
Know, Josh, I'm not available all of next week. And then the following week, I'm not a free the second, the third I am for a little bit, the fourth is out completely and the Friday the fifth.
Move the player to 853.82 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
14:13
So that would be a squeeze.
Move the player to 857.34 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
14:17
Got to. Okay. Plus the hardware. Okay.
Move the player to 860.08 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
14:20
Question
How long does the hardware take to get there?
Move the player to 861.46 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
14:21
Yeah, roughly five two seven days.
Move the player to 863.77 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:23
Yeah, yeah, well, usually it can depend anywhere between three two seven, you know, it can kind of greatly vary just depending on how you PS how busy UPS is. That's true. Yeah.
Move the player to 875.3 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
14:35
Okay. Yeah, so yeah, so as far as things that won't work, I mean, I don't really think there are any. As long as we can get the full setup, I think we're good.
Move the player to 889.71 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:49
Yeah, exactly.
Move the player to 890.63 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:50
So yeah, so what we'll do is we can retouch that via email when we get a little like once we get the user detail sheet back once we get everything added and shipped out, we can kind of go based on that right and say, okay, you know, let's look at our schedules, let's see what's open and then we can go from there and get everything scheduled and stuff.
Move the player to 909.12 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
15:09
Yeah, so I'll go ahead and pass it over to Tricia. Did you have anything else that you needed to go

Over?
Move the player to 917.69 seconds in the call

Speaker 3
16:43
It's static.
Move the player to 1004.77 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
16:44
Okay. So that's internal network. So we would need to assign the phones a static IP beforehand.
Move the player to 1014.18 seconds in the call

16:54
Okay, yeah.
Move the player to 1022.19 seconds in the call

Speaker 3
18:24
Yes.
Move the player to 1105.9 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
18:25
Okay, these phones technically are Wi-Fi capable. We just don't want a full Wi-Fi layout with this many phones. So if the majority can be hardwired, that would be great.
Move the player to 1116.76 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
18:36
Absolutely. Yeah, there's I mean, I maybe a couple I would think about putting on Wi-Fi, but they'll all be hardwired.

Patricia Rael
18:43
Okay, great.
Move the player to 1124.77 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
18:44
And then in the user details, if you could just list since there is three separate paging, just let me know if there's an extension tied to them because we can add those, I don't know if your current phones, if they have them as like a speed dial button or anything like that to page.
Move the player to 1139.5 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
18:59
There is. So yes, I will add those.

Patricia Rael
19:04
Question
And then we did get that your main number when it's dialed right now, it just goes straight to a menu, correct?
Move the player to 1150.45 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:10
Question
Or does it ring into like person first?
Move the player to 1154.62 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
19:14
Okay. Go straight.
Move the player to 1156.52 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:16
Okay.
Move the player to 1157.34 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:17
If you do want to keep that same greeting, what I can do is I can call in and retrieve that, or if you have access to the audio file directly, you can always send that to us, but I usually just call in and I can record it.
Move the player to 1170.92 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
19:30
Yeah, I mean, that would be that would be perfect because I don't think I can get that from our current provider. Okay.
Move the player to 1179.24 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:39
Yeah, no problem. I'll call in and get it. If I have any questions on that to you, I know you said you'll send the group information. If you want to add that in the sheet, that's perfectly fine.
Move the player to 1188.62 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:48
Next Steps
Or if I have any other questions on any other menu options, I'll reach out to you via email on that.
Move the player to 1195.26 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
19:55
I'll call after hours to just to see what the greeting is there and see if it's just going to a voicemail or just an announcement.
Move the player to 1203.21 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
20:03
Okay, great.
Move the player to 1204.9 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:04
Question
Do you want voicemail to email enabled for all users?
Move the player to 1208.28 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:08
So if someone gets a message, they'll get an audio copy. OK, perfect.
Move the player to 1213.89 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
20:13
Yeah, I would say so. That's the kind of the way I set up now. I don't even know if people actually use it, but that's how it's set up now.
Move the player to 1221.21 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:21
Ok, great.
Move the player to 1222.78 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:22
Do you need international dialing enabled?
Move the player to 1227.31 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
20:27
Um, not really. Yeah, okay.
Move the player to 1231.34 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:31
It's not common anymore, but.
Move the player to 1234.7 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
20:34
Okay, yeah, okay, okay.
Move the player to 1237.24 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:37
It's not common. What I can do though. Yeah, I mean, what's happened stuff, make it kind of null now.
Move the player to 1244.28 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:44
But in case you did need it, what I could do is like if yourself as an admin wants to enable it for a user, you can.
Move the player to 1250.77 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
20:50
So I'll enable it on an account level, but technically no one would still be able to dial unless you enabled it for them.
Move the player to 1260.25 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:00
Okay.
Move the player to 1262.15 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:02
Question
And then do you currently have Loype phones or is that what your current setup is?
Move the player to 1268.06 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
21:08
Yeah we have Sangoma excuse me we mostly Sangoma 500 series.
Move the player to 1274.32 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:14
Okay do your phones have any special configurations like call parks so if you place someone on a park everybody can see that call waiting.
Move the player to 1284.67 seconds in the call
Speaker
21:24
Um
Move the player to 1286.15 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
21:26
No I will I don't think so.
Move the player to 1291 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:31
Question
Okay, is that something you'd like to add to your phones?
Move the player to 1294.22 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:34
Because it's a feature we can add. It's instead of placing them on hold, because only your phone would see that call waiting if you placed them on hold.
Move the player to 1301.29 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:41
You placed them on a park and everybody can see that call waiting and can pick it up by pressing the park button.
Move the player to 1307.96 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
21:47
I wouldn't think that could be useful, yeah.
Move the player to 1310.32 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
21:50
Okay, a few call parks. And then you have quite a few users, so we can't really add another feature called a BLF or a presence for everyone.
Move the player to 1320.26 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
22:00
But each phone or each user can kind of personalize their phone with certain users that maybe they monitor a lot or that they call a lot.
Move the player to 1330.44 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
22:10
So that might be better to just work on afterwards, just because it's probably easier to see and personalize once once the users have the funds in front of them.
Move the player to 1342.01 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
22:22
Yeah, we have a thing said to be totally agree.
Move the player to 1344.55 seconds in the call
Patricia Rael
22:24
Ok. And then we'll also just make sure we have the speed dials for paging preset as well. Once I get the user details in the extensions for them, then I'll make sure that's added.
Move the player to 1357.13 seconds in the call
Speaker 3
22:37
Okay,
Move the player to 1357.53 seconds in the call

Move the player to 1366.74 seconds in the call
