Yeah, so today's call is to essentially gather as much information. So or as much information as possible, so we can start building the services. Okay.
Move the player to 111.2 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
01:51
So like in regards to the quote, it was listed for 10 standard users, you know, a fact service or physical facts with a, you know, little box that we ship out 10 desk phones and importing six telephone numbers.
Move the player to 126.25 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
02:06
So for those 10 standard users are these like people with first and last names where they have their own individual. phones.
Move the player to 134.48 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
02:14
Well, sure, but I don't need people's first and last names because, I mean, this, this job is seasonal. So I don't have the same people every year.
Move the player to 143.51 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
02:23
Gotcha.
Move the player to 144.01 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
02:24
Question
So do you want to just give them some sort of like generic name, like Berlin phone one through 10?
Move the player to 152.57 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
02:32
Well, we certainly could do that. I'll tell you what, what I'm most concerned with Joshua is the, the, the, the phones that I have over in the waterbury office from

Joshua Kirby
02:43
You guys.
Move the player to 165.66 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
02:45
Longest Customer Story
There's still such a lack of knowledge in how to use these phones. Like we're not even sure how to transfer calls. We can't get calls. We can't get our messages from another location from that office.
Move the player to 182.13 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
03:02
Longest Customer Story
Types of all types of things that we need to get on top of this so we know how to run the phones better. And so this is the reason I never started with Berlin during the tax season.
Move the player to 193.96 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
03:13
Longest Customer Story
It's because there's such a cluster going on a bet in, um, in water berry, trying to use these phones because I, I thought that someone might, might actually do some training with us.
Move the player to 205.07 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
03:25

Move the player to 235.55 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
03:55
Question
Is that what you're referring to?
Move the player to 238.49 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
03:58
Right, right. So that I could call, like, I could call my other office from this office and get my messages and all that type of stuff.
Move the player to 247.15 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:07
You know, that's slightly different. So having an admin user is just so you could go in and if you wanted to add services, remove services, make any adjustments to your service. And just being able to call between.
Move the player to 260.94 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:20
Let me see here. Let's take a look.
Move the player to 262.56 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby

From anywhere I am, I can get my messages. Like I can now in the Berlin office.
Move the player to 269.51 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
04:29
So you're talking more like the Beehive account would help me say like right now, I think we've got it set up so that the front desk, the phone rings to the front desk four times before it goes to the offices to be answered.
Move the player to 282.96 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
04:42
I would go in there and change now that on the off season, it rings once and then goes to the offices.
Move the player to 287.74 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:47
Exactly.
Move the player to 289.14 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
04:49
Okay. So that's the type of stuff we want some help with and that's why we want the Beehive account. Okay.
Move the player to 293.79 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
04:53
Yeah, so what I'll do is I will send you an email once we wrap up and it'll allow you to schedule training. Okay, that'll be great.
Move the player to 305.17 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
05:05
And then the cool thing is it can be recorded and all of that stuff.
Move the player to 307.58 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
05:07
So they can send your recording of it and you know, that way you can share it with anyone that, you know, isn't able to make it to that call or anything like that.
Move the player to 315.06 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
05:15
So and they'll train you on how to do both sides. I'll set you up for the one that gives training for admin. So like stuff like going into the account and I can get you access.
Move the player to 323.78 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
05:23
To all of that stuff as well. I'll send you another like auto email that I'll just say, you know, hello, thank you for signing up for Bravo is click here to create your password.

And you will create a password. Your username will just be your email that we have here on file. And let's see here.
Move the player to 345.56 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
05:45
Yeah, so we'll
Move the player to 347.24 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
05:47
Make sure to get you that access.
Move the player to 364.53 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:04
Okay, and then just so yeah, so we can get you all that access and you know get you set up as a as an admin and get you access into that and then get you set up for training.
Move the player to 374.39 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:14
In regards to the names for the phones for Berlin. Do you just kind of want to go with a generic naming convention I mean it can always be updated down the road as well.
Move the player to 384.97 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
06:24
Well, and I don't think I want six phone lines because right now we have three phone lines that are coming in and out.
Move the player to 391.8 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
06:31
I got, I don't use one of those phone lines that I had for my fax machine.
Move the player to 396.72 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
06:36
Question
Not my fax machine, my credit card machine, right?
Move the player to 400.5 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:40
Right. Yeah. So we don't support because we're going through the internet now. Yes. Exactly. So you're probably doing it through the internet. I was going to say that. Exactly. OK.
Move the player to 406.81 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
06:46
Question
So why do I have six phone lines then?
Move the player to 410.27 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
06:50
I think I got to take a look at my Comcast bill.
Move the player to 412.85 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:52
Question
Yeah, I mean, if there is something that you don't need, you would just essentially let us know, right?
Move the player to 417.97 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
06:57
Because we just go based off of whatever is on the quote. And then when we get, you know, whatever information from you guys, we then just input that based on what you guys provide to us.
Move the player to 429.48 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
07:09
Right, sure. And I think what I provided, because I thought you guys could process my credit cards on the phone line, but you can't. So we've got that with Wi-Fi now.
Move the player to 438.29 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
07:18
And then, yeah, so the six lines I'm seeing here at Waterbury are is yourself Robin, uh, ... front desk and Dustin.
Move the player to 449.2 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
07:29
Right. Like ... isn't even here anymore. So I really didn't need it to be .... It could just be extra desk now.
Move the player to 455.36 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
07:35
And then, um, as far as is here, I think that we would just have like, um, three and three waterbury, three lines, Berlin, three lines.
Move the player to 465.65 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
07:45
So when you're talking about lines are a very different thing than phones and users. And I think that's a very important thing that you need to understand.
Move the player to 474.52 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
07:54
Question
So in Waterbury, how many physical phones do you need?
Move the player to 478.28 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
07:58
Question
And in Berlin, how many physical phones do you need?
Move the player to 481.74 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
08:01
So in Waterbury, we have four phones and in Berlin, we're going to need 10. OK, so
Move the player to 489.85 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
08:09
Yeah, there's five. So there's currently five phones in Waterbury. That's right.
Move the player to 495.6 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
08:15
You're right. There's five.
Move the player to 496.84 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
08:16
Okay. So that's not that's not five lines. That's five users. That's right. Yeah. And five phones. So so you don't have six lines.
Move the player to 505.33 seconds in the call
Speaker
08:25
You have lines don't really exist, so to speak, in this system.
Move the player to 510.96 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
08:30
Question
How many lines do I have in Watebary?
Move the player to 513.43 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:33
You have two telephone numbers at Waterbury, but what he's trying to explain is that it no longer works in the same way where you have like lines.
Move the player to 520.81 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:40
Question
It's like you have telephone numbers and then you can have users with their own unique phones, whether it be digital or physical, right?
Move the player to 527.98 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:47
And then we can plug in that information in various ways, but it's not really directly tied to lines specifically anymore. So you have two telephone numbers, a main line and a fax line.
Move the player to 539.33 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
08:59
Question
And then we essentially from that main line, there is a way through calling and reach the front desk person, if they don't answer, then it goes to the ring all group, right?
Move the player to 549.56 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:09
You know, it has various ways to then reach how whatever type of call flow you guys, you know, want us to build for you guys.
Move the player to 558.88 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
09:18
Okay.
Move the player to 560.12 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:20
Right?
Move the player to 560.32 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:20
Question
So like let's say for instance for Berlin, right?
Move the player to 562.34 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:22
If it's 10 phones, we just need to put a naming convention for those 10 phones, depending on the business. Sometimes, you know, hey, it's, you know, this phone is for John and only John will be using this phone.
Move the player to 572.81 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:32
But sometimes like you said, it's like, hey, you know, it's just 10 phones that sit around. Anyone can pick them up. People come people, you know, hop on, people leave off.
Move the player to 580.39 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:40
You know, it could be something where it's just Berlin phone one, Berlin phone two, you know, something, but we do have to put some sort of name on it, but it doesn't have to be first name last name.
Move the player to 590.31 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
09:50
But that's... not can. Once she gets the beehive
Move the player to 593.49 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
09:53
Account, the admin privileges, would she be able to change these lines or these. phone line, the user names or so.
Move the player to 602.11 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:02
Yeah, exactly. That's what I was referring to earlier, exactly. So that's just changing.
Move the player to 606.53 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:06
Essentially, that's just updating the name once you have the know-how, and then just rebooting the phone, which is just turning it off for 10 seconds, plugging it back in, and then it should reboot.
Move the player to 617.2 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:17
Or it happens automatically at midnight every night. Any changes yourself on the admin side or someone from Broad Voice makes, it'll automatically just update at midnight if you didn't want it. have to reboot the phone.
Move the player to 629.94 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
10:29
Okay, and then so in Waterbury, we've had an issue with the fax line not working. When we first got the phones, it, you know, it worked for a little bit and now it's just not been working.
Move the player to 644.99 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
10:44
Is that something that we could possibly see if there's a setting wrong in the beehive admin account to.
Move the player to 653.16 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:53
Yeah, we can take a look at that. I'll look into that.
Move the player to 657.87 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:57
Question
What could be causing?
Move the player to 659.11 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
10:59
Question
So you guys are expecting all these problems, huh?
Move the player to 661.55 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
11:01
You were expecting just to set up new service. But I'm sorry, we've been having a lot of issues in Wadi-Bering.
Move the player to 668.33 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
11:08
We're just kind of dealing with it right now, but it'd be great if we could, you know, transferring calls and things like that, putting calls into voicemail.
Move the player to 676.49 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
11:16
Yeah, because when I looked at the training for the beehive account, that gives a lot more stuff that we can do once we have that account.
Move the player to 685.24 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
11:25
But by us not having it, we're kind of restricted in a lot of things.
Move the player to 690.7 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
11:30
Question
But I think what you're saying is we've had it all along, right?
Move the player to 694.12 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:34
Yeah, so, so yeah, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you access to the admin portal, Penny. So you should get that in your email in a couple of minutes.
Move the player to 702.44 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:42
And then so I can also, we can also send you guys some stuff to help with some of the stuff that you guys are referring to, like transferring.
Move the player to 712.86 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
11:52
In regards to transferring for you guys, you guys didn't initially give oh, well, no, never mind you guys do that extension so With transferring is on your phone.
Move the player to 724.35 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:04
Question
Do you see a button that?
Move the player to 727.19 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:07
Question
Let me see what is the button Steven?
Move the player to 728.83 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:08
Well, you know what the button looks like for the transfer button on the poly edge phones
Move the player to 733.52 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
12:13
Yeah, we know how to transfer. The big problem is figuring out how we can make it ring a certain way or getting the voicemails not being in the office.
Move the player to 744.94 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:24
Gotcha. So getting voicemails not being in the office is pretty simple as well. We can do a voicemail to email transcription.
Move the player to 753.78 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:33
We just need well, we have pennies email and I'm not sure if we have we may or may not have other people. Let me see here.
Move the player to 759.79 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:39
Question
Yeah, I think we only have pennies for now, but we just need email addresses, right?
Move the player to 765.33 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:45
And then we can plug them in and turn on the voicemail to email transcription. And then.
Move the player to 771.29 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
12:51
Well, so there's not a way that you could we could just call into call a number and get into the voicemail.
Move the player to 778.72 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
12:58
Question
From out from an outside phone from like your cell phone, right?
Move the player to 782 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:02
Yeah. Um, let me think
Move the player to 786.91 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
13:06
Or even having multiple beehive accounts. Cause.
Move the player to 792.85 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
13:12
Question
In the beehive account, I believe you can see the voicemails, right?
Move the player to 797.21 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
13:17
Yeah.
Move the player to 797.67 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
13:17
So each user, if they log in to the communicator, which is either on the phone or on a computer, you'd be able to see your own voicemails.
Move the player to 806.2 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
13:26
And if there's a general voicemail, they can be assigned to that as well and see it there.
Move the player to 810.08 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
13:30
The only way to do it by calling in is we would have to, basically, since you don't have an auto attendant or anything, we would have to set up like a separate number for you to call in.
Move the player to 818.25 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
13:38
And you can set it to go to... like a voicemail login.
Move the player to 823.71 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:43
Right. Yeah. That's all. Yeah, exactly. I was going to refer to that too. So we can give you like a free number. And we would essentially just put it to voicemail login.
Move the player to 834.42 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:54
And then you would follow, we would create like a pin and a code for a specific voicemail box.
Move the player to 839.79 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
13:59
Or for each of you guys would have your own voicemail box to have your own pin and code that then whenever you dial that new number, it would actually, hey, log in with your box number and then type in your pin.
Move the player to 851.35 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:11
And then you would get access to your voicemail, your individual, if you wanted to call directly to check that.
Move the player to 859.57 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
14:19
Question
But again, how do we set up the multiple beehive accounts?
Move the player to 863.82 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
14:23
Question
Could we do that through her admin account once we get that?
Move the player to 867.01 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:27
Next Steps
Yeah, you can do it through the admin account or if you guys just want to make it do it easier I mean you could just get send me an email after this with everyone's email or you know Hey, here's email for Dustin.
Move the player to 876.27 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:36
Here's for the front desk.
Move the player to 877.17 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
14:37
Here's for you know Whoever we're gonna put for ... hour if that's just left-blank then we leave that one blank and then just robin right And then we would input those and I would do the same thing I just did for penny where I send an auto email out because otherwise, you know You would have to I would have to send you guys instructions But I would have to stay in you instructions on where to go to that because it's not, you know, obviously like one of the first things you'll see when you log in.
Move the player to 902.96 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
15:02
But yeah, we can get it done for you guys in one of the various ways that we can do it. Whichever, whichever you guys prefer, really, it's up to you guys, whichever most comfortable for you all.
Move the player to 913 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
15:13

So that's at least good, at least the number is showing as good. And it's not like a number issue.
Move the player to 1181.16 seconds in the call

There's a, so the little box you had for the plug into the facts, there's a line one in a line two.
Move the player to 1189.7 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
19:49
And when it was working, when we first put it in, talking to the phone with someone, line one didn't work. So then we put it in line two when it started working.
Move the player to 1202.09 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
20:02
Question
So what did matter between if it's in line one or two of that box?
Move the player to 1206.4 seconds in the call

It should always be in line one.
Move the player to 1208.02 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
20:08
Okay.
Move the player to 1211.3 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
20:11

You know what I just noticed, Steven as I went and looked at the device for whatever reason line two. I just went. Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't going crazy.
Move the player to 1241.49 seconds in the call

Penny Farrell
22:00
Okay. Yeah.
Move the player to 1322.22 seconds in the call

Move the player to 1346.45 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
22:26
We already had the call flow and then just let me see here actually let me take a look at one last thing for your numbers for Berlin. What's the main line is the 9100 correct.
Move the player to 1358.92 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
22:38
That's correct. Okay,
Move the player to 1360.44 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
22:40
Perfect. And then what's the facts line. 1734
Move the player to 1364.82 seconds in the call
Speaker
22:44
Okay. Wait a minute. Is that. Yeah, 1734. Yeah.
Move the player to 1376.14 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
22:56
Perfect, okay.
Move the player to 1380.43 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
23:00
Question
Because I I've sent you that Comcast bill, so do you do you have that for those numbers?
Move the player to 1385.48 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:05
Yeah, yeah, I still have all that information.
Move the player to 1399.97 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:19
Okay, yeah, so I'll get everything set to ship out.
Move the player to 1402.53 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:22
Question
And then are the rest of the numbers, or are they direct lines, or are they where they just kind of other numbers you guys had that weren't really being used?
Move the player to 1410.37 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
23:30
Well, they're just that we use them all the time. If the calls come in on 9100, if 9100 isn't available, they come in on the next line. Gotcha,
Move the player to 1420.39 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:40
Exactly. So that's exactly what we were referring to earlier.
Move the player to 1422.69 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:42
That technology is kind of gone away now, right?
Move the player to 1426.09 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:46
Where technically the numbers can operate independently from each other and they don't require physical lines to function in the same way.
Move the player to 1434.25 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
23:54
So what we typically do is, you know, let's say for instance, you did want a direct line that, you know, a family or friends can.
Move the player to 1440.41 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:00
Question
Reach you on, you know, or even clients, right?
Move the player to 1442.85 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:02
You give it out to specific clients, hey, you know, reach me at this line, if you can't reach me at the main number, you know, something along those lines.
Move the player to 1448.53 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:08
Question
And if you didn't want that, then we just have it mirror whatever the main line does, right?
Move the player to 1453.09 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:13
So it's essentially functioning the same as someone were to somehow know that number. If, you know, they dial it, it'll just ring the same as the 9100.
Move the player to 1466.89 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:26
Okay. Okay. And then that was everything I had on my end.
Move the player to 1471.4 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
24:31
Question
Steven, was there anything that you needed on your side?
Move the player to 1474.82 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
24:34
Just a few basic pieces of information that I usually gather just to be safe. So like some of the network information just to be safe.
Move the player to 1482.35 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
24:42
Question
Who's your internet service provider?
Move the player to 1487.85 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
24:47
I'm
Move the player to 1488.91 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
24:48
Not sure if you have a
Move the player to 1516.23 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
25:16
Okay, so just the you just have the Comcast router. Okay. Right. Okay, that's fine.
Move the player to 1521.73 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
25:21
No, we don't have an HR block on it. Yeah, we got a. Help this thing go on. We
Move the player to 1531.62 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
25:31
Got a cradle point. We got a cradle point router from headquarters. So it's the same setup as what you see in Waterbury. The exact same setup.
Move the player to 1542.52 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
25:42
We didn't gather some of that information because it was expedited and it kind of got pushed out really fast. So it should work fine.
Move the player to 1549.71 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
25:49
Next Steps
But the other thing too, also, it just kind of brings me to this point too, is in this follow up email, we'll make sure Josh gets it out to you, the whitelisting information.
Move the player to 1563.96 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
26:03
So like as an example, I sent the test facts on our side. It's shown completely cleared. So if it's having an issue reaching the ATA, it could even be something that's not whitelisted properly on that firewall.
Move the player to 1575.51 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
26:15
You know, I'm not saying that is that. I'm just saying that is always a possibility. So I would maybe reach out to whoever does that controls that firewall and give them that information just to be safe.
Move the player to 1590.12 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
26:30
Okay.
Move the player to 1592.46 seconds in the call

Move the player to 1614.05 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
26:54
No, I don't think we do.
Move the player to 1615.86 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
26:55
Now, and again, just like anything else, nothing is set in stone. So if you need it down the road, you can always call somebody here and get it enabled. Okay. Okay.
Move the player to 1626.52 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:06
And you know, it's even real quick.
Move the player to 1627.58 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:07

What, what, what's the code for if they need to reach support for any reason on their phones?
Move the player to 1632.57 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:12
Is it star six
Move the player to 1634.89 seconds in the call
Steven Hatch
27:14
Question
One one?
Move the player to 1635.83 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:15
Yeah. So if you guys are, yeah, six one one, if you guys do need any assistance directly from your Broadway phones, you can always just dial six one and that gets you direct to support.
Move the player to 1646.16 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
27:26
Okay, didn't know that either.
Move the player to 1649.32 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:29
Exactly. And so that'll be that. The phones were just in South so
Move the player to 1652.2 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
27:32
Quickly over in Waterbury and we were going right into tax season.
Move the player to 1655.05 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
27:35
So we were just kind of like flying by the seat of our pants to just get through it, you know?
Move the player to 1659.15 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:39
Exactly. And you know, hey, it happens.
Move the player to 1660.69 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:40
And like I said, we're here for you guys, you know, thankfully we, you know, I think maybe a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago, two years ago, they started doing the training thing, which has helped tremendously.
Move the player to 1669.75 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:49
So, you know, once you guys take a look at the schedule for that and, you know, that's completely on you guys.
Move the player to 1674.83 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:54
Once you guys get that schedule, it'll be directly with like a Braver's rep and then they'll walk you through everything.
Move the player to 1679.27 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
27:59
And they'll answer any questions you got, any further questions, and obviously anything that you asked us prior to connecting with them will assist you with too. So.
Move the player to 1691.49 seconds in the call
Penny Farrell
28:11
Okay, sounds good.
Move the player to 1693.25 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
28:13
All right, and if you both don't have any other questions, then we can go ahead and wrap.
Move the player to 1697.91 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
28:17
And then just keep in mind that if you guys do have anything, feel free to reach out to myself or Steven will be more than happy to assist.
Move the player to 1703.22 seconds in the call

28:23
Even post completion, you'll have me and him for five business days, and then you'll even have like a dedicated rep for about 60 days.
Move the player to 1709.06 seconds in the call
Joshua Kirby
28:29
So you guys will be completely covered if you do run into anything from now all the way until even a couple of months after completion. So.
Move the player to 1717.01 seconds in the call
