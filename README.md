# BroadVoice Service Automation (BVSA)

## Project Description

The BroadVoice Service Automation project aims to streamline and automate the end-to-end process of extracting, validating, and provisioning customer requirements from sales design calls. This initiative transforms manual, error-prone transcript analysis into an intelligent, automated workflow that ensures accurate and complete order fulfillment for BroadVoice/B-hive telecommunications services.

## Business Objectives

1. **Reduce Processing Time**: Automate extraction of provisioning data from design call transcripts, reducing manual review time from hours to minutes
2. **Improve Data Accuracy**: Eliminate human errors in data capture through validated extraction and business rule enforcement
3. **Enhance Completeness**: Systematically identify missing critical information before implementation begins
4. **Accelerate Onboarding**: Enable faster customer activation through streamlined order processing
5. **Increase Scalability**: Support growing sales volume without proportional increase in operations staff

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Salesforce transcript cleaning and standardization
- AI-powered data extraction from design calls
- Automated validation against 80+ provisioning attributes
- CSV generation for order management systems
- Gap analysis and follow-up item tracking
- Support for various implementation types (single-site, multi-site, enterprise, seasonal)
- Integration with Salesforce via MCP server

### Out of Scope
- Direct provisioning system integration (Phase 2)
- Real-time call transcription
- Customer-facing portals
- Billing system integration

## Key Components

### 1. Transcript Processing Pipeline
- Salesforce transcript cleanup utility
- Speaker identification and role classification
- Timestamp preservation for audit trails

### 2. AI Extraction Agent
- Natural language processing for multi-speaker conversations
- 4-pass analysis methodology (context, extraction, inference, validation)
- Confidence scoring system
- Specialized handling for complex scenarios

### 3. Data Validation Framework
- Phone number validation (N11 detection, area code verification)
- Address standardization and E911 compliance
- Extension conflict detection
- Device model verification

### 4. Provisioning Output Generation
- Structured CSV format with 8-column schema
- Completion metrics and gap analysis
- Source timestamp tracking for traceability
- Follow-up action item generation
